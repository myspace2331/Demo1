EXP7:To understand Static Analysis SAST process and learn to integrate Jenkins SAST to SonarQube/GitLab.
Steps:
1.Installation of Jenkins
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install Jenkins
Jenkins --version
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl status Jenkins

2.Opening the Firewall
By default, Jenkins runs on port 8080, so let’s open that port using ufw:
   sudo ufw allow 8080

3.Setting Up Jenkins
Visit Jenkins on its default port, 8080, using your server domain name or IP address: http://your_server_ip_or_domain:8080
You should see the Unlock Jenkins screen, which displays the location of the initial password, In the terminal window, use the cat command to display the password: sudo cat [location]
Copy the 32-character alphanumeric password from the terminal and paste it into the Administrator password field, then click Continue.
The next screen presents the option of installing suggested plugins or selecting specific plugins, We’ll click the Install suggested plugins option, which will immediately begin the installation.
When the installation is complete, create the user.
Once done you will see Jenkins is Ready page. 
Click Start using Jenkins to visit main dashboard.

4.SonarQube Setup
Before proceeding with the integration, we will setup SonarQube Instance. we are using SonarQube Docker Container.
sudo docker run -d -p 9000:9000 sonarqube
SonarQube is will run on port 9000. Then, from the browser, enter http://localhost:9000 , login using default credentials (admin:admin).

5.Generate User Token
Now, we need to get the SonarQube user token to make connection between Jenkins and SonarQube. For the same, go to Administration> User > My Account > Security and then, from the bottom of the page you can create new tokens by clicking the Generate Button. Copy the Token and keep it safe.

6.Jenkins Setup for SonarQube
Install SonarQube Scanner plugin in Jenkins. 
Go to Manage Jenkins > Plugin Manager > Available. 
From here, type SonarQube Scanner then select and install.

7.Tool Configuration SonarQube Scanner
Go to Manage Jenkins > Configure System > SonarQube Server. 
To Add SonarQube. Fill  following fields:
Name- SonarQube
Server URL- http://localhost:9000
Authentication token in the Jenkins Credential Manager and select the       same in the configuration.

8.Set-up the SonarQube Scanner
Go to Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration > SonarQube Scanner
Click Add SonarQube Scanner Button
From there, give some name of the scanner type and Add Installer of your choice.

9.Integrate the SonarQube Scanner in the Jenkins Pipeline
